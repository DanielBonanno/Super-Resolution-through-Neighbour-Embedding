# Single Image Super-Resolution through Neighbour Embedding

Work related to the unit: CCE5224 - Digital Image Processing


This is a MATLAB implementation of [1], which performs super resolution of images.

There is also a powerpoint presentation which describes aspects of this paper and how the algorithm works, and shows some results.
